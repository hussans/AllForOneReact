**Project Name**: All For One React Rebuild
<br/>
**Description**: This project is a React-based rebuild of "All For One," designed to closely match the original Figma design while ensuring full responsiveness across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Each Mini Challenge is developed as its own component for better structure and maintainability. Data validation is implemented to ensure accuracy and reliability.
